**INPUT EXPLANATION:**

This code defines a class `AISearchTool` that utilizes various libraries and models to perform an intelligent search on the web. The tool generates a search query based on a given prompt, searches for results using DuckDuckGo, extracts content from relevant URLs, and verifies the relevance of the extracted content.

**CLASS EXPLANATION:**

The `AISearchTool` class has several methods:

1.  **`__init__`**: Initializes the tool with an optional model name (defaulting to "llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M").
2.  **`generate_search_query`**: Uses the LLaMA model to generate a search query based on the provided prompt.
3.  **`search_duckduckgo`**: Performs a DuckDuckGo search using the generated query and returns the top 10 results as a list of dictionaries.
4.  **`extract_content`**: Extracts the main content from a given URL using trafilatura.
5.  **`verify_content_relevance`**: Verifies if the extracted content contains information relevant to the original prompt by asking the LLaMA model.
6.  **`search`**: The main search function that returns the best relevant result.

**ANSWER:**

To use this tool, create an instance of `AISearchTool`, call its `search` method with a prompt as input, and it will return the most relevant result if found.

**CONFIGURATION EXPLANATION:**

The model used by the tool is set to "llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M". This can be changed by passing a different model name when creating an instance of `AISearchTool`.
